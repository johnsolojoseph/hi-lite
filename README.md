## About:

As humans, we have very short attention spans. We are extremely busy and we hardly have time to sit and read. Well, to keep up with the trend, we want to help deliver information faster. We want to create a web application fused with AI and ML to help the user get the summary of any particular article they choose. A TLDR for every blog and news story. :alien:

All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](https://github.com/mdo/code-guide), maintained by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).
